## What Chelis Is

Chelis is a functional language for AI research, built for a workflow where a coding
agent is the primary author and a human is the supervisor, and where the programs are
themselves AI systems: models, training loops, search spaces, learned functions. The
bet is that a type system, representation, and compilation model designed around AI
primitives from the start beat ones bolted onto Python or a systems language later. It
is not a general-purpose language, a systems language, a web framework, or a Python
replacement. `spec/00-context.md` and `spec/design/chelis_canonical_reference.md` own
the full statement; their specifics may lag, their intent does not. When a tradeoff
appears, apply these in order:

1. **Unambiguity over ergonomics.** The author is an agent. The friction a human feels
   spelling out every type, effect, dtype, and dimension is not worth a reading the
   compiler has to guess at.
2. **Composition over special cases.** A new capability composes existing primitives
   before it earns a new one.
3. **Inference over annotation.** Where the checker determines something uniquely, the
   author does not repeat it; intermediates carry no ascription.
4. **Machine generation first.** A convenience that exists only for a human typist is
   not a reason to add syntax, a default, or a fallback.
5. **Additive sugar only.** Every surface form desugars to the core; nothing in the
   surface has semantics the core lacks.
6. **Explicit over implicit.** No implicit broadcasting (`expand` only), no implicit
   precision promotion, no implicit currying or partial application, no silent
   narrowing at ingress, no hidden effects. Where intent cannot be determined uniquely,
   the compiler rejects.
7. **Small language, big library.** The compiler knows only the closed RISC primitive
   set and its derived built-ins; everything else is a library. The canonical reference
   §8.5 has the core/standard-library/external-library taxonomy.
8. **Future-proof without over-building.** Decide the rule fully now, implement what
   the phase needs, and never narrow a rule to what a lane implements today.

Two corollaries govern how the compiler itself is changed. Chelis is pre-compatibility
unless a controlling contract says otherwise, so prefer the structural design that
makes a defect class impossible over a smaller-blast-radius patch, a legacy default, a
versionless compatibility fallback, or phase deferral; close the class, not the
instance. And determinism is part of the contract: for fixed program text, compiler
build, target, and declared inputs, every check, evaluation, and build result is a
function of those inputs, and feedback that varies between identical runs is a defect.

## Quality Standards

### Spec-First Development

- Before writing implementation, write test stubs derived from the owning spec.
- Every spec requirement should have a corresponding test before the code exists.
- If the spec says "X is a type error," write the failing test before implementing
  the checker.

### Negative Test Parity

- For every test that checks something works, add the corresponding failure test.
- If you cannot name the failure case, the spec understanding is still weak.

### Do Not Trust Green

- Passing tests prove alignment with the tests, not necessarily with the spec.
- After green CI, check what active requirements still lack tests.
- Audit silent fallbacks, default values, empty error vectors, and `unwrap_or` paths.

## Review And Merge

### Red Team Rounds

Run every round through the [`redteam-exec` skill](agent-skills/redteam-exec/SKILL.md).
It carries the brief shape, the worktree-reuse rules, and the verify mode.

- Red team against the spec, the code, the tests, the examples, and the CLI behavior.
  Execute tests and commands; source inspection is not proof.
- Every pull request, documentation-only work included, gets at least one round before
  merge. A round is the whole live back-and-forth between one reviewer and the author,
  not a single review pass:
  1. A fresh local subagent reviews the exact head from an inline brief and reports
     its findings.
  2. The reviewer stays alive. The author repairs the findings in the worktree.
  3. The author hands the repair back, and the same reviewer verifies it and looks for
     similar issues the repair may have missed or introduced.
  4. Any further finding goes back to the author, and steps 2 and 3 repeat.
  5. The round ends only when that reviewer states it is satisfied.
  A reviewer that has reported is not finished; it is waiting for the fix. Ending the
  loop after the first report, or verifying a repair with a different reviewer, is not
  a round.
- A pull request gets at most three fresh rounds; a fourth needs the user's explicit
  approval. A prose-only pull request gets one, and a second needs the same approval.
  The pull request's round record is the counter. Verification by the standing reviewer
  does not count; the end-of-pull-request round does.
- A finding is in scope only when the pull request introduces it, worsens it, or claims
  to correct it. Discovery during review does not bring a pre-existing defect into scope.
- A confirmed in-scope P0 or P1 merits a fresh round after the current round finishes,
  within the cap. Unmigrated assertions, old comments, and minor documentation drift do
  not. A rebase does not by itself merit a round: send a hand-resolved intersection that
  stays within files the standing reviewer already read to that reviewer for focused
  verification, and use a fresh round only when the rebase introduces a new mechanism or
  touches files that reviewer did not read. A targeted review of substantial rebase
  overlap needs no permission and never counts toward the cap.
- For documentation and design reviews, severity follows contract impact. A wrong
  normative rule, or a plan that cannot close a named in-scope deliverable, is P0 or P1.
  A design document that misdescribes current `main`, or exposes a sequencing seam while
  the contract stays achievable, is P2 or P3 and is recorded as residual work, never
  promoted to a merge blocker. Wording, line-level accuracy of the pull request body,
  staleness against a sibling pull request's moving head, and anything whose fix would
  add text without a necessity sentence are out of scope.
- State a pull request's claim at the granularity its oracle proves. An unbounded
  universal claim invites sampling in every round and can never be closed.
- A finding class is the defect category, not its file, line, or wording instance.
  Every round record names the class of each finding. When two consecutive rounds
  report the same class, or replace a repaired finding with a different class, stop
  patching witnesses: change the representation, the oracle, the claim, or the brief
  before running another round.
- Repairs may correct, remove, or narrow the pull request's content. They must not add
  design scope, mechanisms, inventories, or promises merely to absorb a finding. When a
  correction would need that, reduce the claim and track the rest outside the pull
  request.
- Freshness is a property of the reviewer's context, not the filesystem. Hand a
  reviewer an existing worktree and its warm target only when it is at the exact review
  head, has a known clean baseline, and has no concurrent writer, and paste the output of
  `.venv/bin/python scripts/worktree_status.py` into the brief as the evidence. Unknown
  or not-clean means wait, and free is the probe's best answer rather than a proof: a
  run that takes no lease, `--fast` among them, is caught only by a scan of the
  processes it spawned. A reviewer whose probes mutate tracked source gets its own
  worktree, and you never edit a worktree a reviewer is reading.
- Before spawning a fresh round, retire only your own stale or failed subagent handles;
  a standing reviewer awaiting a fix is neither. If a spawn routes to remote
  infrastructure, errors, or comes back broken, retire it and retry until you have a
  working fresh local subagent, or state that red-team validation is blocked.

### Pull Request Lifecycle

The mechanics are expensive to get wrong, and
[the PR-author guide](docs/guard_changes_for_pr_authors.md) owns them. Read it before
starting and again before merging, and use the acknowledgement lines it requires.

1. Fetch `origin/main` and base the branch on it. Run `python3 scripts/gate.py --fast`,
   push, and open the pull request before the first red-team round so CI runs in
   parallel. Add a `changelog.d/` fragment. Record the reviewed head and CI evidence in
   the pull request.
2. During a round, consolidate repairs into a local commit and hand that unpushed head to
   the standing reviewer. Push only when the round is closed. If a push or CI rerun is
   already needed, fix every known P2-or-lower finding before it.
3. Do not rebase or merge the base merely because `main` advanced. Fetch, check GitHub's
   mergeability, and inspect the prospective merge with `git merge-tree`. Rebase only
   when that result differs, is unsafe or unclear, or an identified semantic or
   structural issue requires a changed head. If a rebase is already planned, do it before
   any other pushed change.
4. Every base merge, base-changing rebase, or other force-pushed rewrite is declared in
   the PR body with exactly one head-bound line before it is pushed:
   `Candidate-base-update: <new-head-sha> <specific conflict or semantic reason>` for a
   base update, or `Candidate-history-rewrite: <new-head-sha> <specific approved reason>`
   for any other rewrite. The preflight rejects a missing, duplicate, stale-head, or
   empty line. If it rejects an already-pushed head, repair the body and rerun that same
   workflow; do not manufacture another change to satisfy the guard.
5. Never force-push a red gate. Obtain explicit approval before any force push, then
   use an exact-head `--force-with-lease`.
6. Documentation-only changes still require applicable CI on the candidate head.
7. When reviews and repairs are complete and no further content change is planned,
   dispatch `PR Package Expansion` with the pull request number and exact head SHA,
   alongside the final required checks. Merge only after both the required checks and
   the expansion report have been inspected; read its introduced, inherited, and unrun
   counts as the guide describes. An ordinary content change, a base retarget, or a
   rebase the trusted verifier does not accept requires a fresh dispatch. Record the
   reviewed SHA and run link in the pull request.
8. Retargeting the base is an implementation change: `PR Base Retarget Validation`
   holds the head pending fresh compiler and Hull runs. A title or body edit reruns only
   `PR Contract Acknowledgements`.
9. Merge with a squash. Merging closes no issue; close the issues the pull request
   actually resolved as a separate step (see [Issue Tracking](#issue-tracking)), then
   remove the pull request's worktree and task-owned target once no follow-up needs them.

## Spec Authority And Design Discipline

### Documentation Authority

For project-level questions, what Chelis is, what it is for, and what the roadmap says:

1. `spec/design/chelis_canonical_reference.md` controls cross-subject architecture and
   project boundaries.
2. For a transferred chapter, its named capability in the pinned `chelis-plans`
   store controls the subject.
3. An untransferred `spec/00-12*.md` chapter controls its subject.
4. `spec/design/chelis_project_plan.md` controls project sequence that a higher
   authority does not define.
5. `spec/design/archive/` is historical reference only.

Language semantics belong in the numbered spec documents. A chapter transfers only
through a reviewed change that records the transfer; no chapter has transferred, so the
numbered chapters control and the pinned store's captured `chelis-*` capabilities
are reference. If active documents disagree, correct the document that controls the subject. Do not add a
third explanation.

### Normative Specs Are Timeless Contracts

A numbered chapter, a controlling capability spec, and every normative `spec.md` delta
under an active OpenSpec change describe the decided architecture and semantics,
irrespective of how completely any compiler version implements them.

- No project or implementation status in normative specs: no status banners, phase or
  milestone labels, completion claims, delivery histories, PR inventories, oracle
  results, temporary workarounds, or descriptions of what the implementation happens
  to do today.
- State the fully decided rule without weakening it to match a bug, an incomplete
  backend, or a temporary restriction. Never narrow an operation to one dtype because
  that is the only dtype a lane implements today. The implementation moves toward the
  spec; the spec never moves toward bad behavior.
- When an implementation gap would materially mislead a reader, one short
  non-normative parenthetical may say the requirement is not fully implemented and
  link its owning issue. It must not describe the workaround or qualify the rule.
- Sequencing and status live in `spec/design/`, `docs/`, GitHub trackers, or OpenSpec
  proposals, designs, and tasks.

### Numbered Specs Decide; Design Docs Implement

- `spec/00-12*.md` is the authority on WHAT the language does and HOW it must behave:
  semantics, types, dtypes, syntax, effects, op behavior, diagnostics, every
  user-visible contract. `spec/registry/` files are numbered-spec-tier content
  incorporated by reference into their owning `[05-OP-N]` atom, amended under the same
  review discipline.
- `spec/design/*.md` is the authority on how we IMPLEMENT and SEQUENCE those decisions.
  A design doc may elaborate a rule and record its reasoning, but it does not decide one.
- Where the two disagree, the numbered spec wins and the design doc has a bug. Say so in
  the doc rather than reconciling silently in code. When a design doc states a rule that
  is really a language decision, lift it into the numbered spec and leave a pointer.
- Watch for permission-to-mandate escalation. "X is a conforming implementation" in a
  spec does not license "therefore we do X" in a design doc, nor "we do X everywhere" in
  code. If your implementation needs a stronger rule than the spec states, amend the spec
  first and say so in the PR.
- A design doc is not correct merely because it was written down. Before implementing
  it, test its claims against the controlling spec, hardware and ecosystem reality, and
  Chelis's stated principles. If it is wrong, over-broad, or drifted, amend the
  controlling document and tracker before writing code.
- Where the spec leaves a real choice, the tenets above decide it: explicit spelling
  over contextual inference, and the structural design over the patch. If a design doc
  permits both, amend it to select the structural contract before implementing. This
  bias never overrides a normative semantic rule; amend that rule first when the
  language decision must change.

### Numeric Surface Discipline

`spec/design/dtype_semantics.md` §C6 binds every change that touches numeric data,
whether or not you have read it. The census failure messages name the sanctioned
actions; the census, tripwire, and oracle files are guard artifacts, and editing one to
make your change pass is never the fix.

- No numeric channel outside the tagged carrier. A public ADT variant, wire field,
  exported C signature or data declaration, or binding parameter or result that carries
  numbers as bare `f64`/`double`, or takes a raw integer dtype id, is a review-blocking
  finding with no citation or override path: redesign it onto the tagged carrier or
  remove it. Opening a fresh issue does not authorize capacity debt.
  No grandfather, permanent-disposition, successor-override, or integer-plumbing path
  is part of the final contract. Every discovered row ends in exactly one class:
  structurally nonnumeric, a recognized exact tagged carrier, or an exact numeric
  operation registration.
- Every new or changed numeric op, every stdlib ADT constructor with a numeric field
  included, requires an exact semantic registration in the same change set, binding its
  canonical identity to one verbatim existing `[05-OP-N]` atom
  (a definition line beginning `> **[05-OP-N]**`) in `spec/05-risc-primitives.md`. No
  governing atom means you author the atom first; re-check the highest existing number
  on current `main` before allocating. Then run
  `.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_rejection_registries.py --write` and commit the
  generated registry; that artifact is required in addition to the registration.
- Never silently narrow at ingress. A lossy dtype for ingested data is a decision: use
  the named lossy form (the chelis#759 pattern) or the exact dtype, and preserve source
  numeric distinctions as ADT variants (`JsonInt(i64)` beside `JsonFloat(f64)`), never
  one float funnel.
- A new surface kind that can carry numbers (serialization format, IPC channel, export
  mechanism) extends the §C6 enumerators in the same change set, or does not land.
- Published C ABI is configuration-invariant and every declaration is attributable: no
  preprocessor-varying public declarations, no `#line` directives, every published
  header reachable from a declared root. A built-in arithmetic type, bare `int`
  included, makes a callable `numeric-op`; names and parameter-name heuristics never
  turn a callable into plumbing; extents, allocation sizes, indices, and dtype
  selectors are numeric operations, and raw dtype selectors are forbidden. A
  conditional macro definition taints its whole connected local-include component.
  An arithmetic spelling the census does not recognize is a build failure, and so is
  an unclassified new `chelis_types::Prim` variant. PR #956's negative controls lock
  these rules; weakening one changes this contract and those controls together.
- An exported stdlib `def` declares its signature via `defsig`, or stops being exported.

### Public-Surface Change Rule

When behavior changes, update the owning code, tests, docs, and examples in the same
change set: parser, type system, IR, and backend tests; CLI integration tests; the
executable examples in `examples/`; and the active specs and current-state docs. The
[`spec-sync` skill](agent-skills/spec-sync/SKILL.md) walks the surfaces.

### OpenSpec

Chelis plans live in [Chelis-Lang/openspec](https://github.com/Chelis-Lang/openspec),
under `chelis-*` change and capability IDs. This checkout's `openspec/config.yaml`
is only a `chelis-plans` store pointer; `openspec/store.lock.yaml` pins the revision
validated by CI. Register the store before using `openspec`; a missing store is an
error, not permission to recreate a local planning tree. Author and submit planning
changes in a dedicated store worktree; implementation PRs cite the change ID and
accepted store commit. Planning remains optional and Phase 0 remains inactive.
`README.md` owns setup, review order, and the document-only acceptance boundary.
Do not run `openspec init`'s tool generation: `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills`
are symlinks to `agent-skills/`.

## Change Hygiene

- **Changelog fragments.** A behavior-changing PR adds a fragment in `changelog.d/`
  named `<pr-or-slug>.<added|changed|fixed>[.breaking].md`; correct a pending fragment
  when follow-up work changes its claim. Internal work may use the `no-changelog` label.
  Reserve `CHANGELOG.md` edits for release assembly: the release author runs
  `.venv/bin/python scripts/changelog.py build --version VERSION --date YYYY-MM-DD`,
  reviews the preview, repeats with `--write`, and commits the notes, fragment
  deletions, and version bump together, never recreating `[Unreleased]`.
  [The fragment contract](changelog.d/README.md) owns the format.
- **Commit messages.** Plain conventional commits with the configured human author. No
  `Claude-Session` trailers, Codex or Claude attribution, AI co-authorship markers, or
  AI-session links in commit messages or PR bodies. The tracked commit-msg hook rejects
  them; `README.md` explains how it is installed.
- **Issues are closed manually.** Automatic closure is disabled: `Closes #N` in a PR body
  or commit has no effect, and merging never closes an issue. Close one deliberately
  with `gh issue close N --comment "resolved by #<PR>"` once the behavior is confirmed
  on current `main`. Write `Part of #N` or `Addresses #N` when a PR advances an issue
  without finishing it. Close a tracking hub only when every sub-issue is closed and the
  condition the hub names is met.
- **Contract invariants.** Express machine-facing contracts as invariants and lock them
  with tests: perfect success means an empty error list, formatter output stays
  parseable, decompiler output round-trips, executable examples stay executable after
  canonical formatting, status docs claim no more than the repo proves.
- **Manual gates.** Every manual acceptance gate has a documented command, expected
  success condition, and owning phase in [`docs/manual_gates.md`](docs/manual_gates.md);
  if default CI does not run it, the docs say so. Ignored tests are allowed only when
  they clearly mirror a documented manual gate or an environment-dependent prerequisite.
- **CLI surface.** Commands are product surface, not wrappers around library tests. Test
  formatter, decompiler, evaluator, checker, and build behavior against a corpus, and
  test machine-facing output for both shape and semantic invariants. The
  [`cli-surface` skill](agent-skills/cli-surface/SKILL.md) has the corpus rules.

## Issue Tracking

Agents file many issues; use the [`issue-resolution` skill](agent-skills/issue-resolution/SKILL.md)
when picking one up.

- A recurring defect class gets **one tracking issue**, which is also the GitHub
  sub-issue parent for every instance. Its body carries the plan; its evidence lives in
  the owning design doc or `docs/investigations/`. Set the parent link explicitly;
  `Part of #N` in a body creates none.
- Before filing, check whether the issue belongs under an existing tracking issue. Not
  every issue needs a parent.
- An issue has one parent. When a defect splits across classes, parent it to the class
  whose oracle turns green when it is fixed, and add an explicit `Also part of #N` line
  for the other.
- A class without a design doc is legitimate; say so in the tracker.
- `-label:tracking` is the work queue. Prefer the specific label: an issue labelled only
  `soundness` is not findable by anyone who does not already know it exists.

| label | means |
|---|---|
| `tracking` | a hub: a class or a plan, not a work item |
| `bug` | something is not working |
| `soundness` | semantics divergence, type-safety, or a wrong answer; not CI tooling |
| `spec-gap` | normative text was never authored |
| `design-discussion` | the decision exists and is contested, or a design wart |
| `enhancement` | new feature or request (`feature request` is a legacy duplicate) |
| `usability` | developer or user experience |
| `documentation` | docs additions or corrections |
| `failing-on-main` | red on main outside the per-PR checks, nightly- or dispatch-owned; open means still red |
| `nightly-failure` | a nightly workflow failure |
| `no-changelog` | internal change; suppresses only the missing-fragment check |
| `area:eval` | the `chelis eval` interpreter lane |
| `area:runtime` | `chelis-runtime` and the C ABI surface |
| `area:backend` | backend codegen: C, HIP, Metal, and IR lowering |
| `area:prove` | `chelis-prove`, SMT, contract discharge |
| `area:bindings` | Python bindings and the compiler-api embedding surface |
| `area:ecosystem` | shell repos, `reef conform`, ecosystem drift |
| `area:perf` | performance and benchmarking |
| `area:ci` | CI workflows, coverage, mutation testing, dev infrastructure |
| `type-system`, `cli`, `lint` | the type system, the CLI surface, and `chelis-lint` rules |
| `launch:p1` / `launch:p2` / `launch:p3` | launch triage: core promise silently false; loud core failure that ships as a known issue; roughness that does not gate launch |
| `launch:required` | a non-defect launch deliverable or authored decision |
| `demo-path` | breaks a release corpus case; gates launch regardless of priority |
| `fence-ok` | a typed documented rejection is an acceptable P1 resolution |
| `freeze` | a public contract decision that must be authored before launch |
| `scope:core` / `scope:experimental` / `scope:unreleased` | covered by the 0.19 core promise; ships as experimental; outside the public 0.19 release |

## Environment And Tooling

### Worktree And Branch Discipline

- The primary checkout (the main worktree in `git worktree list --porcelain`) is live
  developer state. Read-only queries are fine there; never switch branches, edit, build,
  or create scratch artifacts in it.
- Create a dedicated worktree before the first write of every task, including small
  documentation edits and throwaway probes, and give it its own `.venv` with
  `uv venv --python 3.11`; never copy or symlink another checkout's `.venv`.
- A worktree isolates the working tree, the index, and its HEAD reflog. The stash
  stack, `.git/info/exclude`, the hooks directory, and branch reflogs are shared by
  every worktree on the clone. Do not run `git stash` in a shared clone: to discard your
  own changes use `git checkout -- <paths>`; to park them, copy the files to task-owned
  scratch space or commit them on your branch.
- Do not repurpose an unrelated worktree because it appears idle. Reuse only for the
  same PR or immediate follow-up after checking ownership, exact head, status, and active
  processes. Never share a worktree with a reviewer while either of you writes to it.
- After a PR merges, remove its worktree and task-owned target with individual
  `git worktree remove <path>` and `cargo clean --target-dir <path>` commands, never a
  blanket loop, after confirming the PR is merged, nothing uncommitted is worth keeping,
  and no process owns the target. Squash merges mean "commits ahead of `origin/main`"
  proves nothing; compare patch ids when in doubt. Branch deletion is a separate decision.

### Python And Scripts

- A uv-managed Python 3.11 is a hard prerequisite on every platform. Create each
  checkout's environment once with `uv venv --python 3.11`; `README.md` has the setup.
  Every script is `.venv/bin/python scripts/<name>.py` (`python scripts/<name>.py`
  inside Devenv), and every ad-hoc invocation uses that interpreter too, never the
  system Python. `python3` appears only as the gate bootstrap and for the two
  bootstrap-free diagnostics `scripts/reap_orphans.py` and
  `scripts/preflight_exec_probe.py`, which stay standard-library only.
- Scripts, utilities, report generators, and automation helpers are Python, with tests.
  Rust where the task fits a compiled workspace member. Never shell: the only permitted
  `.sh` is `crates/chelisup/bootstrap/chelisup.sh`. A new `scripts/*.py` needs a
  `[[path_rule]]` or the CI planner fails closed on it.

### Build And Gate Commands

[`docs/local_gate.md`](docs/local_gate.md) records everything `scripts/gate.py` does.
The rules:

```sh
python3 scripts/gate.py --fast         # before every push: fixes in place, then checks
python3 scripts/gate.py --validation   # optional troubleshooting and extra validation
python3 scripts/gate.py --detach --validation   # optional run, detached
python3 scripts/gate.py --status [HANDLE]  # the detached run's real verdict
python3 scripts/gate.py --list         # the canonical command list with ownership annotations
```

- Fetch `origin/main` before any long local validation. Run `--fast` before every push
  of a non-documentation change; trivial changes may warrant focused tests or none.
  `--fast` passing means "no unrouted path and no failing tripwire in my tree", not
  "CI will accept this". CI on the pushed candidate owns routine validation, and the
  workspace suite runs only there and nightly; passing PR checks never certifies a
  phase acceptance oracle, so dispatch `heavy-e2e.yml` on the candidate when claiming
  completion.
- Use focused `cargo check -p <crate> --tests` and `cargo nextest run -p <crate>
  --test <file>` for the inner loop; never a workspace-wide `cargo test`. The same
  applies to a check you want early evidence for: run its owning test locally, for
  example `cargo nextest run -p chelis-cli --test capacity_census_tripwire`, rather
  than dispatching a large workflow such as `heavy-e2e.yml` ad hoc because it happens
  to contain that test. `.config/ci-test-targets.toml` names each test's owner.
- On failure the gate keeps the transcript under `target/gate-failures/` and prints the
  exact rerun command. A detached run's verdict comes from `--status`, never from the
  launch exit code.
- Concurrent builds use an isolated target: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/agents/<name>` as
  an absolute path, or a separate worktree. Before building, run
  `python3 scripts/reap_orphans.py`, review the listing, and reap with `--kill`; at
  session end confirm your cargo, rustc, and nextest processes are gone. Several
  unrelated tests failing at near-identical wall-clock times is CPU starvation, not
  code breakage; rerun on a quiet machine.
- HIP manual gates run only through `scripts/hip_test.py` (or `chelis-hip-test` in
  Devenv); plain `cargo test --ignored` segfaults at exit and looks like a regression.
  [`docs/local_hip_environment.md`](docs/local_hip_environment.md) is the runbook,
  and [`docs/local_macos_environment.md`](docs/local_macos_environment.md) covers the
  macOS first-exec stall (chelis#356).

## Subagents

[`docs/investigations/agent_contract_rationale.md`](docs/investigations/agent_contract_rationale.md)
holds the measurements behind these rules.

- Every subagent prompt names the delivery mechanism and the complete expected report.
  A report that is not sent through the platform's final-report channel has not been
  delivered. A subagent never ends its turn merely to wait for a background build or
  notification that cannot wake it: keep ownership through a synchronous wait, or return
  an honest partial result. A reviewer that has delivered its round report is not
  waiting; it stays available for the orchestrator to resume with the fix.
- CI is watched by at most one background waiter whose exit wakes the session, or by
  nobody. Never watch CI from a foreground sleep or poll loop.
- If an agent returns "waiting" or goes idle without the deliverable, resume it
  immediately with the exact missing items. Prefer a labelled partial report over
  silence or an overstated completion claim, and deduplicate repeated reports that
  race with a resume nudge.
- More than five subagents live at once under one orchestrator needs the user's
  explicit approval and a stated reason. Five is the widest fan-out measured working
  here, not a certified safe width, and it is a separate budget from the CPU one above.
- Every spawn names its model tier and says in one clause why that tier fits: the
  expensive tier for judgement whose errors are costly to detect, the cheap tier for
  mechanical work such as waiting on CI, polling, or transcribing a result. The
  orchestrator states its own context size in the message that announces a spawn.
- Every brief states a numeric report-length budget, and a numeric context budget except
  for red-team rounds. An agent that will exceed its context budget says so and returns
  what it has.
- A brief says which facts the orchestrator has already verified, against what head, and
  that the agent must not re-derive them, and it names what the agent still has to
  establish itself.
- A brief longer than a few paragraphs is a file passed by absolute path, stored where
  it outlives both the agent and the session, never in a per-session scratchpad.
  Inter-agent messages truncate silently near four kilobytes. "Inline" means
  self-contained, the opposite of "read `AGENTS.md`", not pasted into the spawn message.
- Reports come back the same way: the agent writes the report to a file and replies with
  the absolute path and a one-line summary. That reply is the delivery.
- A subagent that reuses a worktree restores its temporary probes and reports the final
  worktree status unless asked to retain them. Before a heavyweight cargo command it
  reports the exact command and expected weight to the orchestrator.

## Writing Chelis Source

Load the [`example-corpus` skill](agent-skills/example-corpus/SKILL.md) before writing
any `.ch`; it carries the Surf style rules, the parse-breaking spellings, and the Deep
AST contract. `spec/02-surf-syntax.md` §0.1 is the authority.

- `chelis build`, `check`, `validate`, and `eval --file` run `chelis fmt --check` and the
  blocking `chelis lint` rules before the front end; style failures block the build.
  `--allow-style-violations` is for emergency local builds only, never CI, and
  `CHELIS_STYLE_GATE_DISABLE=1` is reserved for the integration-test corpus. Run
  `chelis fmt --inplace <file>` and `chelis lint --check` before pushing.
- Type system: no implicit precision promotion, named tensor dimensions match by name,
  no implicit broadcasting (explicit `expand` only), integer literals default to `i32`
  and float literals to `f32`.
- `chelis build` emits C, a header, runtime artifacts, and compile flags; `--target hip`
  emits host code with embedded kernel strings. Neither invokes the native compiler.

## The Chelis-Lang Repositories

One line each, as of 2026-09-21; `gh repo list Chelis-Lang` is the live set, and the
conformance `REGISTRY` in `crates/chelis-conformance` is the authority on which shells
the conformance tooling binds. Every shell consumes the compiler-bundled `chelis-std`
runtime and is bound by the shell contract; the registry records whether it does so
through reef, a Cargo workspace, or Docker.

| Repository | Contains |
|---|---|
| `chelis` | This repository: the compiler, runtime, CLI, `chelis-std`, `reef`, `chelisup`, the numbered spec, and the conformance tooling. |
| `nautilus` | Shell: numerical methods, statistics, linear algebra, optimization, ODE/SDE solvers, special functions. The scipy analogue. |
| `coral` | Shell: typed dataframes whose numeric columns are tensors. The pandas analogue. |
| `shoals` | Shell: quantitative finance on nautilus and coral: pricing, risk, curves, stochastic processes. |
| `school` | Shell: machine learning, sole home of the NN surface (layers, losses, optimizers, training loop, model zoo). Reference implementation of the shell contract. |
| `octant` | Shell: LaTeX-to-Chelis bridge with provenance tracking; a notation adapter, not a CAS. |
| `c-earchin` | Shell: EARS requirements-to-Chelis bridge with property-witness metadata. |
| `calcify` | Shell: Python-to-Chelis translation. |
| `hydronnx` | Shell: ONNX import into Chelis IR. |
| `whale` | Shell: reusable betting models. |
| `hull` | Shell: the executable language specification, a self-hosted reference checker and evaluator differential-tested against the compiler. |
| `hello-chelis` | Example programs; the smallest conforming shell. |
| `beacon` | Shell, early and not yet registered: sound bound-propagation verification over lowered RISC DAGs. |
| `LaCaDiLE` | Lean development of the typing rules: tensor derivatives, ownership, randomness and resource protocols. Supports the soundness work; does not certify the compiler. |
| `buoy` | Rust tracer from normative requirement atoms to evidence, models, proofs, and implementation sites. |
| `sonar` | Neural-network verification in C Note: reconnaissance, corpus, decision briefs. |
| `economoist` | Verified economic and dynamic-programming models in Chelis. |
| `c-note` | The verified-computing web notebook for finance, built on the Chelis stack. |
| `ci` | Reusable CI/CD workflows and pinned actions consumed by every repository. |
| `barnacle` | Standalone Dylint lint libraries maintained by the project. |
| `arb-sys` | Rust bindings to the Arb arbitrary-precision library. |
| `sand-dollar` | S3 cache configuration. |
| `openspec` | Shared OpenSpec planning store, including Chelis's `chelis-*` domain; no compiler or numbered-spec authority. |
| `.github` | Default community health files for the organization. |
| `website` | Astro monorepo for chelis.ch and cproof.ai. |
| `gtm` | C Proof go-to-market: brand, content, sales deck, talk tooling. |
| `Voyage` | Agent-authoring benchmark: quantitative-finance program tasks against shoals. |
| `Benchmarking-grading` | Answer keys for the benchmark, kept out of the solver-visible task repo. |
| `ref-check` | Source-backed bibliography imports and offline LaTeX reference gates. |
| `school-bootstrap` | Clean-room typed-Python references for sklearn algorithms, translated via calcify and vendored into school. |
| `flukeball`, `flukeball_2`, `flukeball_house` | Private betting-model experiments; `_house` is the orchestrator side holding results the authoring agents must not see. |

## Pointers

- **Shared skills** live in `agent-skills/`; `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` are
  symlinks to that one authored tree, `.claude/commands/` and `.codex/commands/` stay byte-identical, and the
  `red-team` alias is wired to `redteam-exec` with its fresh-round and verify modes. The
  set: `redteam-exec`, `spec-sync`, `phase-gate`, `backend-numerics`, `example-corpus`,
  `cli-surface`, `packaging-install`, `issue-resolution`.
- **Toolchain and packaging.** `chelisup` is the installer and pin-resolving `chelis`
  shim; `chelis reef setup` is the orchestrator. Use the
  [`packaging-install` skill](agent-skills/packaging-install/SKILL.md) for any change
  there. One trap it enforces at compile time: `reef setup` subprocesses the real
  `chelisup` binary, never `chelisup::install::install` in-process, because that helper
  copies `current_exe()` over the shim. Design:
  [`spec/design/chelis_packaging_and_install.md`](spec/design/chelis_packaging_and_install.md).
- **Downstream shells** inherit this complete contract through a stamped managed block
  and must satisfy [`spec/design/shell_repo_contract.md`](spec/design/shell_repo_contract.md),
  shipped in the toolchain as `chelis reef conform`. Full inheritance is the default,
  but each shell decides which portions apply. Shell-owned additions stay outside the
  block and should remain when they are relevant and current. To omit an inherited
  section, put its exact ATX heading in a shell-owned span such as
  `<!-- shell-local:exclude:begin -->`,
  `<!-- ### Numeric Surface Discipline -->`, `<!-- shell-local:exclude:end -->`; sync
  removes that heading and its section, while deleting the selector restores it. The
  root `# Chelis Agent Contract` selector omits the entire inherited body.
  Contract changes land here first, editing the doc and the conformance
  `MANIFEST`/`REGISTRY` in lockstep. §7.1 of that doc is the audit a `conform bump` wave
  still owes after the mechanical starter runs.
<!-- END CHELIS MANAGED BLOCK: agents-inheritance -->

- Coral is a downstream **shell repo** for the
  [Chelis](https://github.com/Chelis-Lang/chelis) language, scoped to
  typed dataframes and tabular transformations.
- Intent: a Chelis program should be able to load tabular data, filter,
  sort, group, join, reshape, and window it, and write it back out, with
  typed column access and numeric columns stored as Chelis tensors so they
  flow into the rest of a tensor program. [`spec/scope.md`](spec/scope.md)
  states the full intent and what is deliberately deferred.
- Upstream of truth: `Chelis-Lang/chelis`. The Chelis monorepo's
  `AGENTS.md` rules apply here **verbatim** unless explicitly overridden
  below. That contract covers spec-first development, negative-test
  parity, red-team protocol, documentation hierarchy, example-corpus
  policy, scripting-language policy (Python, never shell), and the
  shared local skill set.

## Toolchain Policy

- Coral should track the latest **published and validation-clean**
  Chelis release by default. Treat stale pins as drift, not as a reason
  to stay on an older compiler.
- `reef.toml` pins the currently validated published compiler exactly, and
  the published Nautilus release built for that compiler. Dependency hashes
  come from the published payload, never a guessed version or a locally
  repacked artifact.
- If the latest published Chelis release fails Coral validation, document
  the blocker in `docs/UPSTREAM_BUGS.md` and pin the newest known-good
  release until the blocker is resolved.
- Validate against the **installed published** toolchain, not a from-source
  build: `chelisup install <version>`, then `chelis +<version> ...` or
  `$CHELIS_HOME/toolchains/<version>/bin/chelis`. The shim also resolves
  from `reef.toml`'s compiler pin, as CI does.
- Bumps cascade in dependency order (Nautilus first, then Coral), because
  Reef requires every dependency to declare the same compiler pin. Resolve
  the exact published dependency with `chelis reef install --from-github
  Chelis-Lang/nautilus@v<version>`, the same path CI uses, and run the full
  Pin Bump Checklist.
- Do not vendor or build the Chelis compiler from source inside this
  repo. Consume the released tarball from the private
  `Chelis-Lang/chelis` releases. CI authenticates via the repo secret
  `CHELIS_RELEASE_TOKEN`, which must hold a PAT with `contents: read`
  on `Chelis-Lang/chelis`. Rotate with
  `gh secret set CHELIS_RELEASE_TOKEN --repo Chelis-Lang/coral`.
- Native test CI uses the released compiler's node-local concurrency:
  `chelis test tests/ --jobs auto`. Keep `--jobs 1` as the local serial
  debugging fallback; do not reintroduce per-file matrix sharding unless
  a documented semantic reason appears.

## Pin Bump Checklist

A pin bump is a **de-narrowing event**, not a version edit. Complete all
of these steps in one change set and land the bump through a pull
request, never by editing the pin directly on `main`.

1. Run `chelis reef conform bump <version>`. Confirm that `reef.toml`
   and every toolchain-installing workflow's `CHELIS_TAG` /
   `CHELIS_VERSION` pair agree, and that the offline pin-consistency
   guard passes. Bump order: `nautilus` (this shell's reef dependency)
   must reach the target pin **first**; flip the `nautilus` dep and
   `NAUTILUS_TAG` to its matching release in the same change set.
2. Run the blocked-probe suite when `tests_blocked/` is populated. A
   **FIX-detected** probe means the upstream limitation is gone: execute
   its de-narrowing instructions, promote it to a real test, remove the
   workaround, and archive the corresponding `UPSTREAM_BUGS` entry. A
   **DRIFTED** diagnostic must be investigated before it is re-cited.
3. Run `chelis reef conform audit --explain` and triage every
   closed-upstream issue still cited by a downstream workaround. Retire
   the workaround or cite the live residue issue; never carry it
   silently.
4. Re-probe every `docs/UPSTREAM_BUGS.md` entry due under its section
   cadence, **per verb and per surface**. A changelog claim is not
   verification. Re-probe manually when a reproducer cannot be expressed
   as a probe (e.g. the Parquet runtime-symbol check, the bare-build
   lane via `scripts/repro_multimodule_bare_build.py`).
5. Refresh `docs/CHELIS_SURFACE.md`: pinned and upstream versions plus
   every `@pin` / `@upstream` marker.
6. Reclassify `UPSTREAM_BUGS` entries from the re-probe results: archive
   fixed behavior, retain live limitations under Tracking or Actively
   blocking, and record any remaining residue and its next trigger.
7. Run the complete local gate before pushing: per-file
   `chelis fmt --check`, `chelis lint --check .`, `chelis reef build`,
   `chelis test tests/ --jobs auto`, `chelis test tests_neg/ --expect
   neg`, the strict pandas parity gate through its isolated Python
   environment (`uv run --project parity python parity/run_parity.py
   --strict`), `scripts/run_static_checks.py`,
   `scripts/run_skill_checks.py`, `scripts/validate_book_examples.py`,
   and `scripts/repro_multimodule_bare_build.py` (all targets). Finish
   with `chelis reef conform audit` and
   `chelis reef conform bump-check --base origin/main`.

Record the per-surface re-probe results and any expected unlocks in the bump
pull request description and a `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Do not check in
per-version migration documents: the repository describes the current pin,
and history lives in `CHANGELOG.md`, pull requests, and git.

## Scope and Acceptance

[`spec/scope.md`](spec/scope.md) owns Coral's intent, architecture as built,
acceptance rules, known limitations, and dated deferrals. `SKILL.md` §5 is the
public API inventory. [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) lists the local gate
commands. The original Phase 3k design plan lives in the Chelis monorepo
(`spec/design/chelis_phase3_plan.md` §3k); `spec/scope.md` records where Coral
as built departs from it.

## Upstream Chelis Bugs

Upstream limitations are tracked in
[`docs/UPSTREAM_BUGS.md`](docs/UPSTREAM_BUGS.md), with executable reproducers
under `tests_blocked/` where the harness can express them and Python probes
under `scripts/` where it cannot. Cite every narrowing by issue number at its
site, or by a dated deferral in `spec/scope.md`; never describe a limitation by
prose name alone.

## Shared Local Skills

Project-local skills live in `agent-skills/`. `.claude/skills` and
`.codex/skills` are symlinks to that directory so both tool surfaces
load the same skill library. `.claude/commands/` and `.codex/commands/`
mirror each other. The complete shared set (`redteam-exec`, `spec-sync`,
`phase-gate`, `backend-numerics`, `example-corpus`, `cli-surface`,
`packaging-install`, and `issue-resolution`) is toolchain-owned material,
regenerated by `chelis reef conform sync`, and stamped in
`agent-skills/UPSTREAM.toml`; do not edit its managed content as a copied
fork. Keep the `red-team` alias wired to `redteam-exec`.

## Scaffolding Drift Rule

All Chelis shell repos share the same scaffolding shape by design. Any
structural change to this repo (layout, CI workflow, agent surface,
reef manifest format) should be mirrored into the other shell repos in
the same change set, or explicitly flagged as a per-repo divergence
with a recorded reason.
